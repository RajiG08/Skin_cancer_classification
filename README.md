# Skin_cancer_classification
Early detection of skin cancer may aid in its treatment, but detection cancer is not easy as it involves laborious tasks. 
Deep learning and transfer learning have been demonstrated to be particularly beneficial in the classification of skin cancer
and medical diagnosis in recent studies. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method for classifying skin cancer. 
We used the Skin Cancer dataset to train the pre-trained ImageNet convolutional neural network to classify nine types of skin cancer.
Dermatologists will benefit from being able to diagnose skin cancer at an early stage.
